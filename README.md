Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection

What is ASD?
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects how individuals perceive and interact with the world. It is characterized by challenges in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The term "spectrum" reflects the wide variation in symptoms and severity among individuals diagnosed with ASD.

What is ASD Detection?

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) detection using deep learning leverages neural networks to identify patterns and traits associated with ASD. This approach uses TensorFlow-based models for training and prediction, providing a powerful tool for early diagnosis and assisting healthcare professionals in better understanding ASD characteristics.
